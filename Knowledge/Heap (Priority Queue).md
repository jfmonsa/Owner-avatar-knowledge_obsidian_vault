+ (Monticulos)
+ Is used to implement a ==Priority Queue== (The most efficient way)
	+ A **Priority Queue** is and ADT (Abstract Data Type) elements with high priority are served before elements with low priority
	+ priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented
## Binary Heap
+ Is a ==Complete Binary Tree==
+ that ==satisfies the heap property==: for every node, the value of its children is less than or equal to its own value.
+ his property makes sure that the root node contains the **maximum*** or **minimum** value

## Types of Heaps
We are focusing in Binary heaps
+ **Min-heaps**: The children keys are less than or equal to the para key
+ **Max-heap**: viceversa
There are other types of heaps

## Array Representation
+ We use an array to represent the tree
+ Given $i$ index of a element in the tree
	+ $2i+1$ to left child
	+ $2i+2$ to right child
	+ $\lfloor (i-1)/2 \rfloor$ to get its parent

## Operations
**Note:** Operations focusing on minheap, for maxheap invert the comparisson
+ **Aux operations** $O(log(n))$
	+ **siftdown**:
		+ Keep swapping the node with its children when they're smaller
		+ if both are smaller we swap with the smaller one
	+ **siftup**
		+ Keep swapping the node with its parent if it greater than current node
+ Insert:  $O(log(n))$
+ update: $O(log(n))$
+ Extract $O(log(n))$
+ Heapify $O(n)$
+ min / max element $O(1)$
## Applications
+ Priority queues:
	+  In a priority queue elements has priority related
	+ elements with the highest priority come at the front
	+ to implement a P.Q. we use a MinHeap or MaxHeap
	+ Operations in PQ:
		+ enequeue $O(logn)$,
		+ dequeue $O(long n)$,
		+ peek $O(1)$,
		+ change priority O(log n) if we have the index else $O(n)$,
		+ is_empy $O(1)$

+ Heapsort $O(nlog(n))$ Heapsort heapifies the array that we want to sort then keeps extracting min until it becomes empty
+ Dijkstra's and Prim's algos

## Operations $O(1)$
+ **Enqueue**:  Adds an item to the queue. if is full (overflow)
+ **Dequeue**: Remove and return its value items from the queue. if is empty (underflow condition)
+ **Front (peek, top)**:  Get the front item without removing it
+ **Rear** (Where elements are enqueued)  Get the rear item
+ **Empty**
+ **Full**
## Applications
+ Task Scheduling in Operating Systems
+ Data Transfer in network communication
+ Simulation of waiting lines
## Implementation
+ Using Arrays
+ Using Linked Lists nodes
